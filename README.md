# figli
This is the figli repository. Figli is a Web3 dApp that allows you to take selfis or images with your device an turn them instantly into shareable NFTs. 
Each time one of your frens unlocks a reshare capability on your image you get rewarded and each time one of your friends remints your image you get rewarded even 
more. 

The idea about Figli is to experiment in how we can better goodonomise the sharing economy by making social images something that gives a little extra.
